# Sokoban-Game
This project was developed as a work assignment for the subject of Object-Oriented Programming which was lectured to me at college on the 2nd Semester of the 1st Year.

This was a group project done by me, and a colleague of mine as well therefore the work was made by the two of us.
The .zip file contains also a .jar version of the program so you can execute it and try the game yourself, enjoy it and play a bit.
